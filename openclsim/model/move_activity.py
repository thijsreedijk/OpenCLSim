    MoveActivity Class forms a specific class for a single move activity within a simulation.

    It deals with a single origin container, destination container and a single combination of equipment
    to move substances from the origin to the destination. It will initiate and suspend processes
    according to a number of specified conditions. To run an activity after it has been initialized call env.run()
    on the Simpy environment with which it was initialized.

    To check when a transportation of substances can take place, the Activity class uses three different condition
    arguments: start_condition, stop_condition and condition. These condition arguments should all be given a condition
    object which has a satisfied method returning a boolean value. True if the condition is satisfied, False otherwise.

    destination: object inheriting from HasContainer, HasResource, Locatable, Identifiable and Log
    mover: moves to 'origin' if it is not already there, is loaded, then moves to 'destination' and is unloaded
           should inherit from Movable, HasContainer, HasResource, Identifiable and Log
           after the simulation is complete, its log will contain entries for each time it started moving,
           stopped moving, started loading / unloading and stopped loading / unloading
    start_event: the activity will start as soon as this event is triggered
                 by default will be to start immediately
